# WebScraping Ecommerce Website Daraz.pk

## Project Description
This project is a web scraping tool that extracts data from the e-commerce website Daraz.pk. The tool can scrape reviews of a single product page, search for products using a keyword search and return the top 80 elements for that keyword, and extract products on a flash sale and return the product name, price, discounted price, top 3 reviews, and rating.

## Approach
The project uses Python and the Selenium library for web scraping. The tool navigates through the website's HTML structure to locate the data and then extracts it using Selenium's built-in methods. The data is then saved in a CSV file for further analysis.

### Scraping Reviews of a Single Product Page
To scrape reviews of a single product page, the tool takes the URL of the product page as input and then extracts the review data, including the review text and the reviewer's name, rating, and date of review.

### Keyword Search
To search for products using a keyword search, the tool prompts the user to enter a search query and then returns the top 80 elements for that keyword. The data returned includes the product name, price, rating, and number of reviews.

### Flash Sale Products
To extract products on a flash sale, the tool navigates to the flash sale section of the website and then extracts the product data, including the product name, price, discounted price, top 3 reviews, and rating.
